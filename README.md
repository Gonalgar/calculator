# Calculator Project

This is a **Calculator** project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum. The project focuses on combining JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a functional and interactive calculator.

## Features

- Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Fully functional numeric keypad with clear (`C`) and backspace (`‚Üê`) options.
- Handles both integer and decimal numbers.
- Keyboard support for input.
- Responsive design for usability on desktop and mobile devices.
- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
